Fiscal Sponsorship Models
-------------------------


In our efforts to promote and support high-level languages, reproducible scientific research and open-source development, NumFOCUS offers a Fiscal Sponsorship program.  The Fiscal Sponsorship program is a way for donors to financially contribute toward the progress of a NumFOCUS affiliated project while also receiving benefits of contributing to 501(c)3 charity. 

NumFOCUS offers two models of Fiscal Sponsorship - *Grantor-Grantee* and *Comprehensive*.  In both models, the project must act to further the tax-exempt purposes of NumFOCUS according to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code as being organized and operated exclusively for one or more purposes including charitable, educational, and scientific.

**Grantor-Grantee model**:

The fiscally sponsored project does not become a program belonging to the sponsor (as is the case with Comprehensive Sponsorship below), but is a separate entity responsible for managing its own tax reporting and liability issues. In addition, the sponsor does not maintain ownership of any part of the results of the projectâ€™s work. The sponsor simply assures itself that the project will use the grant funds received to accomplish the ends described in the grant proposal and that these will further the tax-exempt purposes of NumFOCUS.

**Comprehensive model**:

The fiscally sponsored project becomes a program of the fiscal sponsor and is a fully integrated part of the fiscal sponsor who maintains all legal and fiduciary responsibility for the sponsored project, its employees and activities.  Any work product is available to the public or to the charitable sector. The fiscal sponsor assures funders that the purposes and any restrictions of all grants and/or contributions will be met and these will further the tax-exempt purposes of NumFOCUS.
